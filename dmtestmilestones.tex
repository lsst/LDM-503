LDM-503-1 & 2017-11-30 & NCSA & \textbf{Science Platform with WISE data in PDAC}
SUIT continues PDAC development, adding the WISE data, further exercising the DAX dbserv and imgserv APIs, and taking advantage of metaserv once it becomes available
\\ \hline
LDM-503-2 & 2017-11-30 & NCSA & \textbf{HSC reprocessing}
Validate the data products with the LSST stack match or improve upon HSC products.
 Validate the ops platform in NCSA, including installing the stack, starting and stopping production.
 Generate a validation data set for weekly integration and other tests.
\\ \hline
LDM-503-3 & 2017-11-30 & NCSA & \textbf{Alert generation validation}

LDM-503-11 & 2019-10-31 & NCSA & \textbf{Verification tests in advance of pre-ops rehearsal for commissioning \#2}
More complete commissioning rehearsal: how do the scientists look at data? How do they provide feedback to the telescope? How do we create/update calibrations?
 Exercise control loops.
\\ \hline
LDM-503-12 & 2020-01-31 & NCSA & \textbf{Verification tests in advance of pre-ops rehearsal for commissioning \#3}
