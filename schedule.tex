\section{Master Schedule\label{sect:schedule}}

The schedule for testing the system until operations commence (currently 2022)
is outlined in \tabref{tab:schedule}.
These tests mark the major\footnote{Level 2, in the parlance of \citeds{LDM-294}.} milestones of the DM project.
They are closely tied to major integration events for the overall LSST system,
as shown in \figref{fig:schedule}.
