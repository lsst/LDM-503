\section{Master Schedule\label{sect:schedule}}

The schedule for testing the system until operations commence (currently 2022) is outlined in \tabref{tab:schedule}.
Tests named following the pattern ``LDM-503-NN'' (LDM-503-01, -02, etc) correspond to major \footnote{Level 2, in the parlance of \citeds{LDM-294}.} milestones of the DM project.
These tests are closely tied to major integration events for the overall LSST system, as shown in \figref{fig:schedule}.
This schedule also includes nightly and weekly tests which are executed throughout the construciton period by the continuous integration (CI) system (\secref{sect:tools}).
