\section{Major DM Milestones \label{sect:milestones}}

\subsection{Nightly software integration tests and releases (LDM-503-NLY)}
\label{sect:ldm-503-nly}

Nightly throughout construction, the DM continuous integration system (\secref{sect:tools}) performs a complete rebuild of all major components of the \product{} codebase, executes their associated unit tests, and runs a series of automated small-scale integration tests.
Failures are logged, and the DM team notified.
The resulting build artefacts are packaged for release as a ``nightly build''.

\subsection{Weekly software integration tests and releases (LDM-503-WLY)}
\label{sect:ldm-503-wly}

Nightly throughout construction, the DM continuous integration system (\secref{sect:tools}) performs a complete rebuild of all major components of the \product{} codebase, executes their associated unit tests, and runs a series of automated small-scale integration tests.
Failures are logged, and the DM team notified.
The resulting build artefacts are packaged for release as ``weekly build'', and automatically made available for developer use on shared hardware.
