Suggest we'd run this with the latest release as of the date of the test (so this is 14.N, where 14.0 is the end-of-S17 release). Again from pipelines, I don't care about what the ""ops platform"" actually consists of. Suggest that the plausible availability of services should drive the test plan in this case, rather than vice versa. ""Generate a validation dataset"" is a good aim, but relates to an existing RFC (RFC-243) — need to achieve consensus there about what we're looking for here. Can this also include database ingest?"LDM-503-3,Test report: Alert generation validation,2017-11-30, Validate the alert generation stack performance on several DECam & HSC datasets.," ""Stack"" is probably ill-defined here — is this simply testing science logic, or are we going after a wider integration exercise?"LSST-1200,Test report: Interface verification: single visit,2017-12-07," Verify that all interfaces, including the DAQ, are working to capture images from a single visit.",LDM-503-4,Test report: Aux Tel DAQ integration functionalty test,2018-02-01, The production Aux Tel data acquisition hardware should be available in Tucson in 2018-02.
