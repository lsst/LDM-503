LDM-503-01,,"SUIT continues PDAC development, adding the WISE data, further exercising the DAX dbserv and imgserv APIs, and taking advantage of metaserv once it becomes available",
LDM-503-02,,"Validate the data products with the LSST stack match or improve upon HSC products.  Validate the ops platform in NCSA, including installing the stack, starting & stopping production. Generate a validation data set for weekly integration and other tests.",
LDM-503-03,,2017-11-30,Validate the alert generation stack performance on several DECam & HSC datasets.
LDM-503-04,,The production Aux Tel data acquisition hardware should be available in Tucson. We will prepare by testing the adjacent archive systems.,
LDM-503-04b,,The production Aux Tel data acquisition hardware should be available in Tucson. We will demonstrate integration with the adjacent archive systems.,
LDM-503-05,,Validate alert distribution system and mini-broker fed by live or simulated live data.,
LDM-503-06,,"Test the operation of the DM system prior to ComCam availability in Tucson. Note the LSE-79 requirements for DM services in support of ComCam in table 8. They're required by Nov 2019/Feb 2020; it may be more appropriate to test some of them at a later date?""",
LDM-503-07,,Partial camera data should be available to DM July 31st. We plan to test DM stack with it.,
LDM-503-08,,Demonstrate that we can acquire (and process?) data from the Spectrograph.,
LDM-503-09,,Test how the system will run during commissioning.,
LDM-503-10,,There is a project Milestone that DAQ/DM/Networks are available March 15th. We need to run tests in Feb to show this is ready.,
LDM-503-11a,,ComCam will be in use in Nov. The DM system must be ready to deal with it.,
LDM-503-11,,More complete commissioning rehearsal: how do the scientists look at data? How do they provide feedback to the telescope? How do we create/update calibrations?,
LDM-503-12,,Dress rehearsal: commissioning starts in April, so by this stage we should be ready to do everything needed.
LDM-503-13,,ComCam data will now be available. Demonstrate its use in producing a data release.,
LDM-503-14,,Science Verification starts in April. Demonstrate that all required DM software is available.,
LDM-503-15,,Science Verification data will now be available. Demonstate its use in producting a data release.,
LDM-503-16,,Test readiness for operations.,
LDM-503-17,,Confirm readiness for operations.,
