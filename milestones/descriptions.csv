LDM-503-01,,,"SUIT continues PDAC development, adding the WISE data, further exercising the DAX dbserv and imgserv APIs, and taking advantage of metaserv once it becomes available","From DAX: need to be clear about which WISE datasets are to be loaded: the data wrangling effort required to download, inspect, convert, partition, and load each additional dataset is cumulatively non-trivial for DAX"
LDM-503-02,,\citeds{LDM-534} v3.1 \S3.1 (DRP-00),"Validate the data products with the LSST stack match or improve upon HSC products.  Validate the ops platform in NCSA, including installing the stack, starting & stopping production. Generate a validation data set for weekly integration and other tests.",
LDM-503-03,,\citeds{LDM-533} v1.1 \S3.1 (AG-00),Validate the alert generation stack performance on several DECam & HSC datasets.,"Validate the alert generation stack performance on several DECam and HSC datasets. ""Stack"" is probably ill-defined here: is this simply testing science logic, or are we going after a wider integration exercise? "
LDM-503-04,,,The production Aux Tel data acquisition hardware should be available in Tucson. We will prepare by testing the adjacent archive systems.,"A minimal DM-only system that can archive mocked-up images and demonstrate that they can be retrieved, with provenance and metadata."
LDM-503-04b,,,The production Aux Tel data acquisition hardware should be available in Tucson. We will demonstrate integration with the adjacent archive systems.,A minimal system that can archive simulated images from the Aux Tel DAQ and demonstrate that they can be retrieved.
LDM-503-05,,,Validate alert distribution system and mini-broker fed by live or simulated live data.,Can we test a SUIT interface to the broker at this point? I believe it's not scheduled until later in construction.
LDM-503-06,,,"Test the operation of the DM system prior to ComCam availability in Tucson. Note the LSE-79 requirements for DM services in support of ComCam in table 8. They're required by Nov 2019/Feb 2020; it may be more appropriate to test some of them at a later date?""","""The DM system"" should use some further definition: what do we want to test here? Data flow from ComCam to the Data Backbone, or science processing of ComCam data? Note the LSE-79 requirements for DM services in support of ComCam in table 8. They're required by Nov 2019/Feb 2020; it may be more appropriate to test some of them at a later date?"
LDM-503-07,,,Partial camera data should be available to DM July 31st. We plan to test DM stack with it.,
LDM-503-08,,,Demonstrate that we can acquire (and process?) data from the Spectrograph.,"Per LSE-79, AuxTel delivery in Nov 2017 (ie, a year before this milestone) includes: EFD ETL service, Aux Telescope Archiving Service, Data backbone in support of Aux Telescope archiving. Do we need to schedule another test to cover that?"
LDM-503-09,,,Test how the system will run during commissioning.,Focus on ISR: we should test whatever we have available. See LSE-79 for a list of requirements.
LDM-503-10,,,There is a project Milestone that DAQ/DM/Networks are available March 15th. We need to run tests in Feb to show this is ready.,
LDM-503-11a,,,ComCam will be in use in Nov. The DM system must be ready to deal with it.,"""The DM system"" should use some further definition: what do we want to test here? Data flow from ComCam to the Data Backbone, or science processing of ComCam data? Note the LSE-79 requirements for DM services in support of ComCam in table 8. They're required by Nov 2019/Feb 2020; it may be more appropriate to test some of them at a later date?"
LDM-503-11,,,More complete commissioning rehearsal: how do the scientists look at data? How do they provide feedback to the telescope? How do we create/update calibrations?,
LDM-503-12,,,Dress rehearsal: commissioning starts in April  so by this stage we should be ready to do everything needed.,
LDM-503-13,,,ComCam data will now be available. Demonstrate its use in producing a data release.,"Note that LSE-79 requires a suite of DM services in support of the full camera in May 2020. It seems inappropriate to test them as part of a commissioning ops rehearsal, but they are well before this data. Do we need another test milestone?"
LDM-503-14,,,Science Verification starts in April. Demonstrate that all required DM software is available.,"SV will include calculating all KPMs to demonstrate that we are reaching the science requirements. That obviously means we'll need code which is both capable of reaching those requirements, and calculating the KPMs."
LDM-503-15,,,Science Verification data will now be available. Demonstate its use in producting a data release.,
LDM-503-16,,,Test readiness for operations.,
LDM-503-17,,,Confirm readiness for operations.,
